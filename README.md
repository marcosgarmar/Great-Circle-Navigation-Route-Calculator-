# Great-Circle-Navigation-Route-Calculator-
A haskell program that searches the path between two coordinates using n intermediate points
#  How Work
1 set the  document scs.txt(or other with the same format)as argument with   ``` set args scs.txt ```
2 run the code 
## The program show in the console  and a file  ( soluci√≥n.txt) 
1. The great circle route from the initial coorditantes to the final coorditantes, both the distance and the  course.
2. The loxodromic route tfrom the initial the coorditantes to the final coorditantes, both the distance and the course.
3. Interpolate as many points as they appear in the last parameter of the file in the great circle route and calculate the distances and course from each one of them to the next one (including the initial coorditates and the last coorditates).
